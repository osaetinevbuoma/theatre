# Theatre

Theatre is an android app that uses [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org) as the 
remote server to curate movies and television shows. Your can get an API by signing up. 

Theatre allows you to save favorite movies and 
shows, keep a watchlist of your choosing and search for movies and shows. The app leverages Android
Architecture Components including:

* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room).
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata).
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel).
* [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging).

More information about the Android Architecture Components are available at [https://developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture).

**NOTE: Theatre is a demo app and was not necessarily built with all layout responses/configurations 
in mind.**
